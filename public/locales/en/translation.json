        "text_1": "Graduated from the UBA Faculty of Medicine in 1975, with a first specialization in Nuclear Medicine - the theoretical part studied at the CONEA Heavy Water facilities in Ezeiza, the practical part as a fellow of the Roffo Hospita´s Nuclear Medicine Department. In 1980 I was granted a scholarship from the General Electric CO to study Computed Tomography in San Francisco, California, USA and during those months I also studied Magnetic Resonance in South San Francisco, with Dr. León Kaufman who was developing a prototype. Between 1981 and 1986 I worked in a private clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in charge of Neuroimaging, especially Tomography of the brain and spine. From 1989 to 2002 I worked in total Body Magnetic Resonance with Dr Alberto Eurnekián at the San Martín de Tours clinic and Argerich Hospital (Outsourced Service). Since 1995 to date, I have been in charge of the Computed Tomography Service at the Santojanni Hospital, taking care of the practice and also teaching since  this hospital is attached to UBA Medical School. I have been a Radiographers Professor at UNSAM between 2000 and 2022 as well.",
